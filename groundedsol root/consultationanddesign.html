        <h2>The Process</h2>
			<h6>Making the most of your consultation: Step One</h6>
			<p class="newsDate"></p>
				<p><img alt="Florida Front Yard with Grass" src="images/samples/yard.jpg" class="img-left-shadow img-rotate-left">Let’s walk your grounds together. Your first consultation provides a roadmap from a professional’s point of view. 
				The first hour is about being able to see the property, understand the scope of the project, and decide what is possible, clarifying ideas as we go. 
				We spend time identifying existing problems, future solutions, labor benefits and time drawbacks of each idea or dream. 
				Are you looking to create a bird and butterfly foraging ground? Do you want to reduce the monthly or weekly mowing required? 
				Is water conservation a concern for you? Looking to add some hardscape? Sometimes the best way to move forward is to cut things back. 
				Remove fast growing shrubs and prepare the ground for new plantings. 
				You may want to keep some of your existing plants. 
				It’s all a discussion with suggestions and ideas at this stage. 
				We offer on-site small impact designs, so you can incorporate native plants and build your landscape DIY style after the first meeting.</p>
			<p></p>
			<hr class="fancy">
			<hr class="noshow">
			<h6>Making the most of your consultation: Step 2 Design</h6>
			<p class="newsDate"></p>
			<p><img alt="Digital Layout Design for Yard" src="images/samples/yard2.jpg" class="img-right-shadow img-rotate-right">Next, we work together to produce a design or viable plan to move forward. 
			There are two types of design, a small impact design and a digital design. 
			A small impact design is created on-site. An on-site design brings to paper the ideas suggested during the consult with color and detail. 
			During the drawing I have an opportunity to look up individual plants with you, share which plants will work for each spot, and why they were selected for your landscape.
			 I leave you with a small design, labeled with botanical and common names so you can move forward at your own pace. The second is a digital design that showcases the full property. 
			 A digital design allows me to take the property survey and create a drawing that is true to scale. Over the course of a few weeks I create a concept plan complete with outlines and ideas. 
			 We meet again to review the concept, walk through the plant suggestions, discuss longer term maintenance requirements and seasonal flow of the landscape. We take notes, incorporate changes, and complete the planting details for each listed species for the final design. 
			 If all you need is a direction, we can cover that with the initial consult and an on-site design. Looking for a long term plan? A digital design is the way to go. Wanting someone else to plant the design? We can help coordinate that for you. 
			 Wanting a smaller landscape bed or just a re-fresh of color for spring or fall? We may be able to take care of that quickly by delivering plants, planting and mulching in a day. Getting a design is just a step towards the sustainable Florida landscape you want.

			<h6>Implementing your design and installation</h6>
			<p class="newsDate"></p>
			<p><img alt="Florida's sandy dry soils" src="images/samples/yard3.jpg" class="img-left-shadow img-rotate-left">Design in hand, you are connected to established installation and irrigation contractors.
			 If you choose to have a professional do the digging, that is. 
			 Small orders of plant material can be delivered and staged for the DIY crowd wanting to get their hands dirty. 
			 A Pop-Up plant shop is in the works to bring a regular supply of native plants to Orlando and surrounding neighborhoods. 
			 We recommend nurseries or garden centers stocking true Florida natives to shop at. 
			 Keeping to the mission of restoring ecological diversity natural to this area we recommend species with high nectar content and quality pollen content that is nourishing to our pollinators. 
			 Cultivated varieties and exotic species don't always provide the best nutrients, if any at all. 
			 We enjoy working closely with Green Isle Gardens in Groveland for our plant material. 
			 Green Isle Gardens consistently produces top quality plants that thrive in Florida's sandy dry soils better than exotic box store plants. 
			 When selecting native plants to fill out your flower beds, you'll notice fast growth and bright blooms with our summertime rains, and without unnecessary fertilizer or pesticide treatments. 
			 In-fact, a pesticide free lawn can help bring beneficial insects into the area, diversify the types of butterflies you see, increase dragonfly and damselfly populations, and creating a more interesting landscape for you and any little ones to watch.</p>

			<h6>the growing stage and plant material management</h6>
			<p class="newsDate">&nbsp;</p>
			<p><img alt="Florida Native Plants" src="images/samples/yard4.jpg" class="img-right-shadow img-rotate-right">Just like a new haircut, this stage is the one to get used to. 
			Native plants thrive in our sunny, sandy landscapes. 
			There are also a lot of species that thrive in shady, wet areas. And many plants are adapted for the areas in-between. 
			Selecting the right plant for the right place will allow for each plant to grow to maturity with less attention. 
			But they will need to be monitored, watered frequently and kept mulched in the first few months. 
			After the plant has established it’s roots in the area, watering can drift towards seasonal rain supply and pruning 
			can be addressed on a quarterly basis. It’s always a good idea to keep a 3 inch mulch barrier down to keep drifting 
			weed seeds from taking root. We prefer to use pine needles and fine pine mulch over cypress mulch, so as not to add 
			to the de-forestation of our cypress trees around sensitive wetland areas. It takes some time to get to know the 
			growth habits of these native plant species, and we won’t leave you hanging, just call for a maintenance consult. 
			Grounded Solutions wants your landscape to be successful. So, if for any reason you have questions or concerns, 
			please email us. It will always be our goal to bring sustainable and beautiful landscapes to Florida, and 
			have your property give you a sense of pride in giving back.</p>

				<h4>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h4>
				<ul class="list2">
				<li>Below are a few frequently asked questions that
typically come up during the consultation. Since the
consult is based on an hourly fee, I thought I would
address a few of these now so that your time is best
spent on the consultation.</li>
           
				</ul>
				
				<dl id="acc">
					<dt>What is the best time of year to plant?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">In Florida you can plant any time of year. In winter, colder temperatures reduce growth rate in most plants, 
					therefore plants require less water to get established than in summer months where the growth rate is high and temperatures 
					can be stressful. When planting in spring and summer, supplemental water will help the new root system stay hydrated in naturally hot, 
					dry soils. If late June, July and August bring our normal rainy seasons, nature will take care of extra watering in non-irrigated sites. 
					Spring and fall have bright, shiny, cool days where working in the garden is a pleasure, so it's easy to be outside tending to new plants. 
					Helping them get established.</p>
					<p></p>
					</dd>
					<dt>Do I need irrigation for Natives?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">Irrigation is not necessarily needed long term, but each plant will need water until it is fully established. 
					Each type of plant will have a different establishment interval. Seasonal annuals offer a quick growing life cycle and
					 a relatively short establishment period. Anywhere from 1 - 2 months of attention is sufficient to give annuals their start.
					  Perennials or shrubs with woody stems will need a little bit longer, in the range of 3 - 6 months.
					   Trees are often planted and left to do their thing, but this can give the tree a rough start and stunt long term growth. Trees enjoy regular watering for approximately a year. Regular watering can be through targeted pooling around the base with a hose, 2 - 3 times a week for the first 3 months, and expanding the intervals (but not quantity) over time. Trees should continue to receive water at least 1 time a week for up to, and beyond a year depending on how the tree acclimates to its new soil and light conditions. </p>
					</dd>
					<dt>What is site prep?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">Site prep is the first step of the long term maintenance strategy. 
					When you look at the bed you'd like to re-vamp, or the sodded yard you'd like to reduce,
					 you are looking at your site. Preparation is the process of getting it ready for planting.
					  A short sighted view is to slash down weeds or shrubs, till the ground, then plant. 
					  This will disturb the natural seed bank and encourage rapid germination of undesired weeds. 
					  Mulch or landscape fabrics won't be able to keep them all down. Good preparation is giving time 
					  for that seed bank to become exhausted. Knowing what will grow back after you plant is a big part 
					  of the maintenance strategy.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt>What is your rate?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">My rate is $150/hr. As I work with various clients it becomes clear that each project has a unique 
					scope of attention. Sometimes the homeowner just needs a site review so they can begin to make informed decisions. 
					Sometimes instructions are needed to show which plants will add to the space, and where they should be added or moved. 
					Sometimes there are deeper problems like tree health, soil fertility or erosion issues and I'm needed to work alongside 
					my clients to find real solutions. Keeping a flat rate allows me to take each problem and give it the attention it needs 
					rather than setting price packages for each set of services. </p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>Do you install?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">Yes, small projects are my specialty. For large projects I work with native nurseries skilled 
					in installing full native plant landscapes. I'm happy to work along side you if you like to get your hands dirty, 
					or simply place the plants where they should be planted for those who have a maintenance person they like to work with.</p>
					
					</dd>
                    <dt>Do you deliver plants?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">Yes, small or large deliveries can be scheduled.</p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>What is an annual vs perennial?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">An annual is a vegetative plant that fulfills it's lifecycle in one season. 
					Which means it germinates from seed, grows into a plant, blooms for several weeks and then sets new seeds 
					to be scattered around for the next time the season is right. Annuals frequently occur once a year
					 (like blanket flower, Gaillardia pulchella).  Perennials have a few distinctions. 
					 The classic perennial is a plant that lasts 2 years. The first season it grows vegetatively, sets a flower, 
					 then sets seed. As the bloom and foliage die, energy is put back into the roots and they don't die. The second year, 
					 just when you thought it was gone, it re-grows from the roots, flowers and sets seed, then it dies completely,
					  (like spotted beebalm, Monarda punctata or tropical sage, Salvia coccinea).
					   New seeds pop up and start the cycle all over again.
					    Perennial can also refer to something that doesn't die back completely but can be severely cut back or frozen 
					    back between seasons (like firebush, Hamelia patens). </p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>What is this plant?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">Take a look at my gallery for images and information. 
					I should have a few links to my favorite plant databases. Remember to use the botanical name when looking up
					 the plant for more accurate information.</p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>Do you sell weed?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">No, but there are a host of native medicinals out there. Let's keep the research going.</p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>What is a larval host plant?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">It's a plant that has a specialized relationship with a specific species of butterfly. 
					<a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/wildflower/searchAllButterflyImages.asp?offset=0" target="_blank">Florida Museum.ufl.edu</a>.  
					The butterfly is a beautiful creature who will drink from any cup, but will only lay their eggs on a particular
					 type of plant. That's because the larvae, when it hatches will be so small it has to start eating right away. 
					 The worst type of raw vegan possible. They will only eat the freshest foliage on a particular genus, 
					 or species of plant. So, this is what we mean by habitat, grouping plants together that exist in concert 
					 with insects to form the base of the food web.<a href="images/samples/Monarch%20egg-0044%20resized.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Monarch Larvae" height="252" class="img-shadow" src="images/samples/monarchegg.jpg" width="373"></a></p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>How do I attract butterflies?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">Flowers that produce nectar and have a tubular shape to them can be planted. 
					Larval host plants will bring them around to mate and lay eggs, which provides regular 
					flight patterns to enjoy from a window or from the porch.</p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>Do native bees sting?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">Honey bees, wasps or yellow jackets are what we think of when we imagine being stung. 
					Honey bees sting to protect the large quantity of honey they collect. 
					Wasps and yellow jackets are fine until the nest is disturbed, and their stinger are large so they hurt a lot.
					 Native bees tend to be small. Many of them are no larger than a dime. 
					 Native bees are also solitary bees, nesting in 3/8 inch diameter holes or buried in the ground. 
					 Each hole is home to just a few larval eggs. Each egg is left with enough nectar and pollen to grow into a 
					 strong young bee. Since native bees don't make a large quantity of honey, they don't have that much to protect. 
					 Often they go about their business right under our noses and we don't even notice. Yes, they can sting, 
					 but they are likely to just fly by. </p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>Why should I use natives in my landscape?
                    </dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">Native plants are the base of the food web for your region. 
					It starts with the smallest insects eating specific plants. 
					Slightly larger insects and animals eat those and so on, until you get to the top predators. 
					Studies show habitat loss as the top reason that the bottom of the food chain is disappearing. </p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>Will my plants look perfect all year long?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">Probably not. Each season brings different temperatures, rainfall, intensity of light and length
					 of evening. Native plants respond to these changes and showcase true seasonality for Florida. 
					 Spring and Summer bring a lot of green growth. Fall brings a lot of color through grasses and flowers. 
					 Winter brings leaf change and dormancy. Cutting away the brown in the Spring will invigorate new growth as 
					 temperatures warm and the sun rises in the sky. </p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>Do you know small project contractors?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">Yes. I have a few contacts that I've been referring to clients to help with tree work, 
					small builds or paver-stone pathways.</p>
					</dd>
                    <dt>What is a low maintenance landscape?</dt>
					<dd>
					<p class="dropcap">All landscapes require some maintenance, but there are degrees to which maintenance 
					can be minimized. For example, a sod landscape with viburnum or podocarpus hedge may need to be trimmed 
					weekly during the summer and monthly during the winter. Native shrubs and trees tend to have a slower 
					growth rate which reduces the trimming schedule to once a year. Shrubs and small perennial bushes may 
					need trimming twice a year to keep shape in the summer and the dead wood cut back in the Spring. 
					Annuals can get away with weeding and deadheading four times a year between each season. 
					So a 12 visit cycle, or 18 visit maintenance cycle per year turns into a 4 visit cycle with the summer 
					and spring visit lasting longer than the others. This cuts down on gas emissions and noise pollution from 
					hand held equipment. Reduced water requirements save money and water as we watch our pristine resources 
					grow scarce. And the biological diversity that occurs with native landscapes can eliminate the need to apply 
					pesticides to the landscape.</p>
