			<h1 class="center">Meet Amanda Martin</h1>
			<hr class="fancy">
		<p class="dropcap">I love anything to do with being outside in this wonderful state. Growing up in Winter Park gave me the visual appreciation of the immense value that flora and
fauna added to any landscape. Becoming aware of the impact it made on our natural resources, gave the curiosity and ecological consciousness to pursue a
lifetime passion and career in the field of sustainable ecosytems. To explore how all living things affect one another, six years ago I became a certified Florida
Beekeeper and now have four hives and produce small batch raw wildflower honey.
<br><br>
<h2>From the beginning</h2>
<br>
	   <img alt="About Amanda" height="300" class="img-left" src="images/samples/amanda2.jpg" width="300">
	   <blockquote class="rightside">
			<p><strong> I would like to</strong> continue 
	   creating pop-up plant shop opportunities to bring hard to find
	   native plants and ecological education to neighborhoods around 
	   Orlando.</p>
		</blockquote>
	   I began my adventure in horticulture by receiving a B.S. in Environmental Studies from the University of Florida, 
	   specializing in horticultural operations. Selecting my internship in Portland, Oregon,
	    I took about two weeks to drive cross country, 
	    visiting national parks and experiencing the immense transition of the landscape from the Mississippi River 
	    to the Rocky Mountains. Reaching my destination at a large tree nursery, Mount Hood in front of me, 
	    I was greeted by a double rainbow, a sign that I was where I was supposed to be. (Photo below, left.)

	   <br><br>
	   Grounded Solutions Inc. began its journey in December of 2013. 
	   My company was set up to be a wholesale organic fertilizer company and I parted ways with Evolving Landscapes. 
	   I rented a small warehouse space during 2014 to store both liquid and granular organic fertilizers. 
	   My first clients were a local hydroponics grower and two farm style grocery stores supplying fresh produce from nearby farms. 
	   I began to solicit entrepreneurial business advice from the UCF incubator and worked to grow my client list. 
	   Due to slow sales in 2014, I returned to agricultural research work. 
	   I was able to keep Grounded solutions open on a limited basis during this time and returned to working full time 
	   with Grounded solutions in 2015
	   <br><br>
	   <img alt="Double Rainbow" height="300" class="img-left" src="images/samples/rainbowfla.jpg" width="300">
	   As a volunteer with the Orange 
	   county chapter of the Florida Native Plant Society, I began to shift my 
	   focus from permaculture, or fruiting plant landscapes, to native plant 
	   landscapes. Both demographics prefer organic fertilizers to synthetic 
	   fertilizers, but the native plant group often opted for no fertilizer 
	   at all. Florida native plants are naturally adapted to nutrient poor 
	   soils often requiring few inputs to grow a successful landscape.<br>
	   <br>My enthusiasm for native plants continued to grow. I was elected 
	   president of the Tarflower chapter (Orange county chapter) and requests 
	   for native plant landscape designs continued. I shifted my focus of 
	   consultation and designs toward ecological functioning landscapes and 
	   placed the mission of wholesale fertilizer suppler on hold.<br><br>
	   Throughout 2015 and 2016 I was able to grow Grounded Solutions into a 
	   full service consultation, design and maintenance company. In 2017, 
	   Grounded Solutions opened it’s first pop-up retail plant shop. The pop-up 
	   plant shop was an retail opportunity in a small, 60’s styled strip mall 
	   in North Orlando. The shop was opened for two months and supplied local 
	   residents with access to sought after native plant material. The shop not 
	   only supplied hard to find plant material, but it created an educational 
	   space for new clients who wanted private consultations and design. 
	   Previous inventory of organic fertilizers were stocked and sold as retail 
	   products during this time. Sales were high and Grounded solutions was 
	   able to grow administratively.
	   <br><br>
	   In 2018, the goal is to continue to 
	   grow Grounded Solutions reach in the community. I would like to continue 
	   creating pop-up plant shop opportunities to bring hard to find native 
	   plants and ecological education to neighborhoods around Orlando. It is my 
	   goal to eventually have a brick and mortar, retail and educational 
	   classroom space where the general public can go to a trusted source for 
	   plants that can bring back pollinator health, water filtration services, 
	   migratory bird food, and a host of ways to make each landscape a little 
	   more sustainable for the future.

					<h3>What Is A Horticulturist?</h3>
					<div class="heading-line"></div>
					<p>
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture" target="_blank">Wikipedia definition</a>: A Horticulturist is someone who applies their knowledge, skills, 
					and technologies used to grow intensively produced plants for human food and non-food uses and 
					for personal or social needs. Their work involves plant propagation and cultivation with the 
					aim of improving plant growth, yields, quality, nutritional value, and resistance to insects, 
					diseases, and environmental stresses. They work as gardeners, growers, therapists, designers, 
					and technical advisors in the food and non-food sectors of horticulture. Horticulture even refers 
					to the growing of plants in a field or garden.</p>

						<p>Drought tolerant, low maintenance plants, offering
food and habitat for many other species are the basis for Grounded Solutions
landscape designs. Our goal is to bring a botanical garden-like atmosphere
to the landscape while keeping valuable resource inputs to a minimum. I am
excited to serve the greater Central Florida area in the Eco-Logical landscape
design field and enjoy the diversity of clients interested in making this transition. </p>
